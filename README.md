## Accessibility and Restaurant Success

#### Overview
<br>#TODO An overview of the project and its purpose</br>
Our team, Ellen, Natalie, and Drew sought out to explore the spending behavior of consumers from a dataset from Kaggle. We specifically wanted to investigate whether there was a relationship between holidays and spending. 

#### Data Sources
<br>#TODO what data sources did we use? What did the raw data look like when we started and then when we brought it into analysis.</br>

  
#### Code Structure and Use
<br>#TODO Instructions on how to use and interact with the project</br>

  
#### Ethical Considerations

1.	Data Minimization
   
In alignment with the principle of data minimization, we ensured that only the essential data necessary for our analysis was included in the dataset. For example, we focused on transactional data, such as product purchases, quantities, and prices, while intentionally avoiding the inclusion of irrelevant or excessive personal information. During the dataset selection process, we made certain that sensitive data (such as payment methods, customer names, addresses) was excluded, thus safeguarding customer privacy and minimizing potential risks.

2.	Bias and Fairness

We placed an emphasis on fairness and inclusivity throughout our analysis. We considered the diversity of demographic regions within the dataset to mitigate potential geographical or cultural biases in our findings. When performing segmentation, we made conscious efforts to avoid assumptions or generalizations that could result in biased or discriminatory conclusions about specific customer groups.

3.	Limitations in Reporting
   
When compiling our analysis, we took deliberate steps to ensure the protection of customer privacy. We made certain that no identifiable information was included in any reports, notebooks, Excel files, or visualizations. By focusing on aggregated trends and summaries, we ensured that our findings adhered to privacy standards while still providing valuable insights. Additionally, when formulating our predictive model, we prioritized privacy compliance, ensuring that the analysis remained useful for decision-making without compromising confidentiality.


#### Results and Future Considerations 
#TODO Summarize results and say what we might do differently in the future.
